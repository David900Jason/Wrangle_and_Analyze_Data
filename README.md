# Wrangle and Analyze Data
This a project related to **DECI Y2 L3 Data Analysis & AI** for the End-of-term project for this year.

I was asked to do a complete data analysis process on (3) different datasets from a Twitter account called [WeRateDogs](https://x.com/dog_rates/)

This project focuses on the whole process:
- Gathering
- Assessment
- Cleaning
- Storing
- Analysis & Visualization
- Reporting
